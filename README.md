# sequences_breakdancing
ü™© Helps brainstorm and save dance move combos [so that the dancer can spend more time drilling instead of thinking]

ü§ó Built for my own satisfaction and im tired of not having more combos when freestyling / at the club lmao

<strong> üíÉ Try it out https://mrvivacious.github.io/sequences_breakdancing/ </strong>

####  üéí Future:
* Practice mode, user chooses what combos they want to chain and set a timer between each combo for "rapid" drills
* Better UI
* Mobile-friendly, I don't anticipate dancers would want to bring laptops to practice on the regular
* Google sign in for user to save combos and share between computer-phone-devices-etc?
* Achievements (5 combos, 10 combos, 30 combos etc idk LOL)
* idk, go practice with actual dancers in person and bring the tool for feedback and to see how ppl use this
* test cases hahahhhhahah sure whatever
* business model? i have no idea, i just wanna have clean footwork üò≠


#### ‚ò∫Ô∏è Things I learned:
- While I'm sure a tool like this exists already (think, Crossfit gyms and their ever-changing workout routines),
 the value of implementing this/any idea from scratch is that the experience offers a new perspective on the idea
 and the technology needed to realize said idea. This perspective can provide new ideas, teach new methods and
 techniques of development and production, exposure to new bugs and systems of dealing with those bugs...etc which
 can carry over to future projects in related and unrelated domains. At least, my rationale for personal projects... ‚ù§Ô∏è
 
- Building a data interface and *attempting* to implement a CRUD design from scratch. In previous projects, I would have API calls 
 sitting throughout the codebase, but after seeing how "professionals" handle data through my jobs, I decided to go with CRUD to keep
 my skills a bit more polished and to help myself realize the benefits of this design. In the specific example of this project, a wrapper
 around the localStorage API to create a more structured way to interact with the Move and Combo data
 
- Using more .js files with specific purposes rather than a large .js file with all the functionality. This helps the codebase
  appear cleaner, more modular, easier to learn and work with... also helps keep the logic simpler, more organized, and easier to write.
  
- I'm apparently a person who would rather spend time building an app to help me/a person dance than actually dance...but I do look forward to future practices
 with a more-fleshed out sequencer :DDDDD
 
- GitHub Actions to deploy a GitHub pages: pretty much a free hosting solution and potential to create a landing, help/faq page, full website, etc.
 How cool!
