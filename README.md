ðŸª© Help brainstorm and save dance move combos so that a dancer like me can spend more time drilling instead of thinking

ðŸ¤— Built because im tired of not having more combos when freestyling / at the club ðŸ˜ž


#### ðŸŽ’ Future:

- Practice mode, user chooses what combos they want to chain and set a timer between each combo for timed drills
- Better UI
- Mobile-friendly, I don't anticipate dancers would want to bring laptops to practice on the regular
- Google sign in for user to save combos and share between computer-phone-devices-etc?
- Achievements (5 combos, 10 combos, 30 combos etc idk LOL)
- idk, go practice with actual dancers in person and bring the tool for feedback and to see how ppl use this
- clean footwork
